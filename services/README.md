## Service Template Structure

Each service follows this structure:
```
service-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # API definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ proto/             # Protocol buffers

## Development Guidelines

### Language Selection
- **Go:** High-performance services, gateways, data processing
- **Rust:** Ultra-low latency, security-critical services
- **Java/Kotlin:** Complex business logic, enterprise integration
- **Python:** AI/ML, data science, scripting
- **Node.js/TypeScript:** Real-time services, BFF (Backend for Frontend)

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous:** gRPC (service-to-service), REST (client-facing)
- **Asynchronous:** Kafka (event streaming), RabbitMQ (task queues)
- **Real-time:** WebSockets, Server-Sent Events

### Data Management
- Each service owns its data
- No direct database access across services
- Use events for data synchronization
- Implement CQRS where appropriate

### Observability
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Prometheus metrics
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready)

### Security
- mTLS between services
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting & throttling
- Input validation & sanitization

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless services
- Load balancing with consistent hashing
- Auto-scaling based on metrics

### Database Sharding
- User-based sharding (100M users per shard)
- Geographic sharding (region-based)
- Time-series sharding (for historical data)

### Caching Strategy
- L1: In-memory cache (per instance)
- L2: Redis (distributed cache)
- L3: CDN (edge caching)

## Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline
```
Code Push â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Security Scan â†’ Deploy to Staging â†’ Integration Tests â†’ Deploy to Production
```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green:** Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary:** Gradual rollout (1% â†’ 10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
- **Rolling:** Update instances one by one

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time metrics dashboards
- Automated alerting (PagerDuty, Slack)
- Log analysis & anomaly detection
- Performance profiling

## Service Registry

All services are registered in the service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for:
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Circuit breaking
- Retry policies
- Traffic management

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Service
```bash
# Use service template
./scripts/create-service.sh <service-name> <language>

# Example
./scripts/create-service.sh user-profile-service go
```

### Running Services Locally
```bash
# Start infrastructure (databases, message queues)
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Start service
cd services/<service-name>
make run
```

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# E2E tests
make test-e2e

# Load tests
make test-load
```

## Documentation

- **Architecture Decisions:** See `/docs/architecture/adr/`
- **API Documentation:** Each service's `/docs` directory
- **Runbooks:** `/docs/runbooks/`
- **Training Materials:** `/docs/training/`

## Current Services

### Production (Current Implementation)
- âœ… **chat-service:** Core chat functionality (FastAPI monolith - to be decomposed)

### Planned (Phase 1 - Next 12 Months)
- ðŸ”„ **auth-service:** Authentication & authorization
- ðŸ”„ **user-profile-service:** User profile management
- ðŸ”„ **messaging-service:** Direct messaging
- ðŸ”„ **ai-agent-service:** AI chat agent
- ðŸ”„ **media-service:** Media upload & processing
- ðŸ”„ **notification-service:** Push notifications
- ðŸ”„ **websocket-gateway:** Real-time communication

### Future Phases
- Phase 2 (Months 13-24): 50+ services
- Phase 3 (Years 2-3): 500+ services
- Phase 4 (Years 3-5): 5,000+ services
- Phase 5 (Years 5-10): 50,000+ services

# Zero World - AI as Air

> **"This app is air for humans"** - Making data access as natural as breathing

## 🌬️ Philosophy

Zero World is an **AI mediator** between humans and data. With this app, humans can access all data in the world easily - like breathing. The interface is invisible, the interaction is natural, and the response is instant.

### Core Principles
- **Invisible**: UI appears on demand, disappears after use
- **Effortless**: Natural language, no commands or syntax
- **Instant**: <1 second response time (P95)
- **Universal**: Access 1000+ data sources seamlessly
- **Natural**: Like breathing - inhale (ask) → process → exhale (answer)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### � Try the Air Interface

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/00-01/zero_world.git
cd zero_world

# 2. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Run Flutter app
cd frontend/zero_world
flutter pub get
flutter run

# 4. Press Cmd+Space (or Ctrl+Space) to summon the Air Interface
# 5. Ask anything: "What's the weather?" "Search for AI news"
```

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Breathing Basics (COMPLETED)
- Air Interface: Transparent breathing UI
- Hotkey activation: Cmd+Space / Ctrl+Space
- Breathing animations: 4-second inhale/exhale cycle
- Sky blue design with cyan glow effects
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Documentation: Complete philosophy and architecture

### � Phase 2: Universal Data Access (IN PROGRESS)
- **Universal Connector** (Rust): Core service for parallel data fetching
  - ✅ Architecture and orchestration
  - ✅ Two-tier caching (L1: memory, L2: Redis)
  - ✅ Wikipedia adapter (working)
  - 🔄 5 adapters (Google, Weather, News)
  - Target: 50 adapters by Month 3

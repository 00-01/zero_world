# Zero World - AI Agent Architecture

## 🤖 Overview

Zero World has been fundamentally reimagined as an **AI-agent-first application**. Instead of traditional app navigation with menus and tabs, everything is driven by conversational interaction with our AI agent named **"Z"**.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Talk to do, not tap to find"**

Users don't navigate through menus — they simply tell Z what they want to do:
- "Order pizza"
- "Book a ride to downtown"
- "Show my wallet balance"
- "Find a doctor"
- "Post something to my feed"

Z understands natural language, recognizes intent, and takes action.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. **Main Chat Interface** (`main_chat_screen.dart`)

The app opens to a clean, Google-style search interface with:
- **Centered input field**: Single text input for all interactions
- **Z Avatar**: Visual representation of the AI agent
- **Voice button**: Tap to speak instead of type
- **Quick suggestions**: Common actions displayed as chips
- **Conversation history**: Chat-style messages with action cards

### 2. **AI Service Layer** (`ai_service.dart`)

The brain of the application:

```dart
// Intent Recognition
IntentType _recognizeIntent(String content)
- Analyzes user input using regex patterns and NLP
- Identifies 30+ intent types (order, book, search, pay, etc.)
- Extracts entities (food types, locations, amounts, etc.)

// Response Generation
AgentResponse _generateResponse(IntentType intent, Map entities)
- Generates contextual responses
- Creates action cards for rich interactions
- Determines navigation targets

// Context Management
- Maintains conversation history
- Tracks user preferences
- Learns from interactions
```

### 3. **Conversation Models** (`models/ai_chat.dart`)

**Data Structures:**
- `ChatMessage`: Individual messages (user/agent)
- `ChatSession`: Complete conversation with context
- `AgentResponse`: AI responses with intent and actions
- `ActionCard`: Interactive widgets in responses
- `QuickSuggestion`: Pre-defined quick actions
- `IntentType`: 30+ recognized intents

### 4. **UI Widgets**

**Message Bubble** (`widgets/message_bubble.dart`)
- Chat-style messages with avatars
- Processing indicators
- Embedded action cards
- Timestamps

**Action Card** (`widgets/action_card_widget.dart`)
- Product cards (images, prices, actions)
- Service cards (restaurants, doctors, rides)
- Transaction cards (orders, payments)
- Booking widgets
- Confirmation dialogs

**Quick Suggestion Chips** (`widgets/quick_suggestion_chip.dart`)
- Common actions as tappable chips
- Emoji icons for visual recognition
- Context-aware suggestions

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### First Launch
```
1. User sees Z logo with "What can I help you with?"
2. Quick suggestions appear: 🍕 Order food, 🚗 Book a ride, etc.
3. User can type or tap a suggestion
```

### Conversation Flow
```
User: "I'm hungry"
  ↓
Z: "I found some great restaurants near you" 
   [Pizza Palace Card] [Burger House Card]
   ↓
User: Taps "Order Now" on Pizza Palace
  ↓
Z: Navigates to restaurant menu
```

### Voice Interaction
```
User: Taps mic button
  ↓
Z: Shows "Listening..." animation
  ↓
User: "Order pizza"
  ↓
Z: Transcribes to text, processes intent
  ↓
Z: Shows restaurant options
```

## 🧠 Intent Recognition

### Intent Examples

```dart
// Food Ordering
"order pizza" → IntentType.orderFood
  → Shows restaurant cards
  → Extracts: foodType = "pizza"

// Transportation
"book a ride to downtown" → IntentType.bookRide
  → Shows ride options
  → Extracts: location = "downtown"

// Shopping
"buy wireless headphones" → IntentType.buy
  → Shows product cards
  → Extracts: query = "wireless headphones"

// Finance
"show my balance" → IntentType.checkBalance
  → Displays wallet balance
  → Shows recent transactions
```

## 🎯 Action Cards

Action cards are the primary way Z presents information and options:

### Product Card
```dart
ActionCard(
  type: ActionCardType.product,
  title: "Wireless Headphones",
  subtitle: "$89.99 • 4.5⭐ • Free shipping",
  imageUrl: "...",
  actions: [
    CardAction(label: "View Details", actionType: "navigate"),
    CardAction(label: "Add to Cart", actionType: "execute"),
  ],
)
```

### Service Card
```dart
ActionCard(
  type: ActionCardType.service,
  title: "Pizza Palace",
  subtitle: "Italian • 4.5⭐ • 25-35 min • $2.99 delivery",
  actions: [
    CardAction(label: "Order Now", actionType: "navigate"),
  ],
)
```

### Booking Card
```dart
ActionCard(
  type: ActionCardType.booking,
  title: "Economy Ride",
  subtitle: "4 seats • $12.50 • 5 min away",
  actions: [
    CardAction(label: "Book Now", actionType: "execute"),
  ],
)
```

## 🔄 Navigation Pattern

Traditional apps: Home → Menu → Category → Item → Action
Zero World: Chat → Intent → Action → Result

```
Old Way:
User opens app → Taps Food → Browses categories → 
Finds restaurant → Views menu → Adds to cart → Checkout

New Way:
User: "Order pizza"
Z: Shows top pizza places with "Order Now" buttons
User: Taps one → Direct to checkout

Saved: 5 taps, 3 screens, 30+ seconds
```

## 🗣️ Voice Interaction (Planned)

```dart
VoiceInputState {
  isRecording: bool
  isProcessing: bool
  transcription: String?
}

// Future integration with speech_to_text package
_startVoiceRecording()
  → Record audio
  → Convert to text
  → Process as regular message
  → Respond with voice output (text_to_speech)
```

## 📊 Context Management

Z maintains conversation context to provide intelligent responses:

```dart
ChatSession {
  messages: List<ChatMessage>
  context: {
    'lastIntent': 'orderFood',
    'lastLocation': 'downtown',
    'preferences': {...},
    'recentOrders': [...],
  }
}

// Example:
User: "Order pizza"
Z: Shows pizza places

User: "The first one"  // Ambiguous!
Z: Understands "first one" refers to first pizza place in context
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Z Avatar**: Purple-to-blue gradient
- **User messages**: Primary color (purple)
- **Agent messages**: Light gray (light mode) / Dark gray (dark mode)
- **Action buttons**: Gradient (purple-to-blue)
- **Suggestions**: Light gray with border

### Typography
- **Z Logo**: Bold, 64pt (home), 24pt (header)
- **Message text**: 15pt, regular
- **Card titles**: 16pt, bold
- **Card subtitles**: 14pt, regular, gray

### Animations
- **Message appearance**: Fade in + slide up
- **Voice recording**: Pulsing red circle
- **Processing**: Animated dots ("Thinking...")
- **Suggestions**: Gentle scale on tap

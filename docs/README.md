## 🌬️ What is Zero World?

Zero World is the **universal AI mediator** between humans and ALL digital services.

```
CURRENT WORLD (2025):
Human → Google (search)
Human → Amazon (shopping)  
Human → Uber (travel)
Human → Facebook (social)
... 1000+ different apps

ZERO WORLD (2030):
Human → ZERO WORLD → [All Services]
         ↑
    ONE interface for EVERYTHING
```

Every digital interaction flows through Zero World:
- Want to know? → Zero World mediates
- Want to buy? → Zero World mediates
- Want to go? → Zero World mediates
- Want to talk? → Zero World mediates

**Not an app. AIR.**

## � Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Current)
- ✅ Air Interface (Flutter) - Breathing UI with Cmd+Space hotkey
- ✅ Universal Connector (Rust) - Mediation architecture
- ✅ Wikipedia adapter (working proof of concept)
- 🔄 4 adapters in progress (Google, Weather, News)
- 📋 Intent Recognition service (planned)
- 📋 Synthesis Engine (planned)

**Target:** 50 adapters → 1,000 adapters → 1M adapters → 10B users by 2030

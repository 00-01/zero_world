# AI Concierge System - Complete User Journey Management

**Vision**: AI handles everything from intent recognition to final delivery, like having a personal assistant for all services.

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: üöß In Development

---

## üéØ Core Concept

**User Journey Example - Food Delivery**:
```
User: "I want pizza"
AI: "I'll help you order pizza! What type do you prefer?"
User: "Pepperoni"
AI: "Great! I found 5 nearby pizzerias. Here are the top 3 with best ratings..."
User: "The first one"
AI: "Perfect! Papa's Pizza. What size - small ($12), medium ($16), or large ($20)?"
User: "Large"
AI: "Any special instructions or add-ons?"
User: "Extra cheese"
AI: "Large pepperoni with extra cheese ($22). Confirm your delivery address: 123 Main St?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "Payment method - credit card ending in 1234?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "Order placed! Estimated delivery: 35-40 minutes. I'll track it for you."
[AI monitors order status]
AI: "Your pizza is being prepared..."
AI: "Driver picked up your order. ETA: 20 minutes."
AI: "Driver is 5 minutes away!"
AI: "Driver has arrived! Your pizza is at the door. Enjoy! üçï"
```

## üìã Technical Components

### **1. Intent Recognition Engine**

**Technologies**:
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Context tracking across messages
- Entity extraction (food type, location, time, etc.)

**Example Intents**:
```json
{
  "intent": "order_food",
  "entities": {
    "food_type": "pizza",
    "urgency": "now",
    "location": "home"
  },
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### **2. Conversation State Management**

**State Schema**:
```dart
class ConversationState {
  String conversationId;
  String serviceType; // "food_delivery", "ride_hailing", etc.
  ConversationStage stage;
  Map<String, dynamic> collectedData;
  List<String> pendingQuestions;
  DateTime lastUpdate;
  OrderStatus? orderStatus;
}

enum ConversationStage {
  intentRecognition,
  categorySelection,
  itemSelection,
  customization,
  deliveryDetails,
  paymentSetup,
  confirmation,
  tracking,
  completed
}
```

### **3. Service Integration Layer**

**Universal Adapter Pattern**:
```dart
abstract class ServiceProvider {
  Future<List<ServiceOption>> searchOptions(SearchCriteria criteria);
  Future<ServiceDetails> getDetails(String itemId);
  Future<Order> placeOrder(OrderRequest request);
  Future<OrderStatus> trackOrder(String orderId);
  Stream<OrderUpdate> subscribeToUpdates(String orderId);
}

// Implementations
class UberEatsAdapter extends ServiceProvider { ... }
class DoorDashAdapter extends ServiceProvider { ... }
class UberAdapter extends ServiceProvider { ... }
class TaskRabbitAdapter extends ServiceProvider { ... }
```

### **4. Payment Processing**

**Secure Payment Flow**:
```dart
class PaymentManager {
  Future<List<PaymentMethod>> getUserPaymentMethods();
  Future<PaymentIntent> createPaymentIntent(double amount);
  Future<PaymentResult> processPayment(PaymentRequest request);
  Future<void> addPaymentMethod(PaymentMethodData data);
}
```

**Supported Methods**:
- Credit/Debit cards (Stripe)
- Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- Bank transfers
- Cryptocurrency (future)

### **5. Real-time Tracking**

**WebSocket/SSE Integration**:
```dart
class OrderTracker {
  Stream<TrackingUpdate> trackOrder(String orderId) {
    return _websocketService.subscribe('order/$orderId').map((data) {
      return TrackingUpdate.fromJson(data);
    });
  }
}

class TrackingUpdate {
  String orderId;
  OrderStage stage;
  String message;
  LocationData? driverLocation;
  int? estimatedMinutes;
  DateTime timestamp;
}

enum OrderStage {
  placed,
  confirmed,
  preparing,
  ready,
  pickedUp,
  inTransit,
  nearby,
  arrived,
  delivered,
  completed
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Components

### **1. Conversation Interface**

**Features**:
- Progressive disclosure (show relevant info as conversation progresses)
- Quick reply buttons for common responses
- Rich cards for options (restaurant cards, ride options, etc.)
- Inline payment UI
- Live tracking map

**Widget Structure**:
```dart
// Main conversation widget with service-aware UI
ConversationWidget
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MessageList
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserMessage
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIMessage
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ServiceCard (restaurant, ride, etc.)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QuickReplyBar
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ServiceProgressIndicator
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LiveTrackingPanel (when order is active)
```

### **2. Service Cards**

**Example - Restaurant Card**:
```dart
RestaurantCard(
  name: "Papa's Pizza",
  rating: 4.5,
  deliveryTime: "30-40 min",
  deliveryFee: 2.99,
  image: imageUrl,
  tags: ["Italian", "Pizza", "Fast"],
  onSelect: () => selectRestaurant(),
)
```

### **3. Tracking Dashboard**

**Real-time Order Status**:
```dart
OrderTrackingWidget(
  orderId: orderId,
  stages: [
    TrackingStage("Order Placed", completed: true),
    TrackingStage("Preparing", active: true),
    TrackingStage("Out for Delivery", pending: true),
    TrackingStage("Delivered", pending: true),
  ],
  map: LiveMapWidget(driverLocation: location),
  eta: "25 minutes",
)
```

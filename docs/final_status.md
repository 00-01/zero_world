# Zero World Application - Final Status Report

## Database Cleanup Completed ✅

### What Was Cleaned Up
- **Old Database**: Removed inconsistent 'zeromarket' database
- **New Database**: Created clean 'zero_world' database with proper structure
- **Collections**: 6 properly structured collections with appropriate indexes
  - users (with email uniqueness)
  - listings (with category and status indexes)
  - chats (with participant indexes)
  - messages (with chat and timestamp indexes)
  - community_posts (with community and timestamp indexes)
  - community_comments (with post and timestamp indexes)

### Fixed Issues
1. **Database Naming**: All services now consistently use 'zero_world'
2. **Port Access**: MongoDB exposed on port 27017 for external tools
3. **Clean Structure**: No old test data or inconsistent collections
4. **Proper Indexes**: Performance optimized for common queries

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If YOU Can't See the App:

#### 1. **Browser Cache Issue** (Most Common)
Clear your browser cache:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Clear cache
- **Firefox:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Clear cache
- **Safari:** Cmd+Option+E

Or try **Hard Reload:**
- **Windows:** Ctrl+Shift+R
- **Mac:** Cmd+Shift+R

#### 2. **SSL Certificate Warning**
When you see "Your connection is not private":
1. Click "Advanced" 
2. Click "Proceed to www.zn-01.com (unsafe)"
3. This is safe - it's YOUR app with YOUR self-signed certificate

#### 3. **Try Incognito/Private Mode**
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P
- Safari: Cmd+Shift+N

This bypasses cache and extensions.

#### 4. **Check Browser Console**
Open Developer Tools:
- Press F12 (Windows) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)
- Go to "Console" tab
- Look for any red error messages
- Share them if you see any

#### 5. **DNS Cache**
If domain not resolving:
```bash
# Windows
ipconfig /flushdns

# Mac
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Linux
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```

#### 6. **Verify Domain Resolution**
```bash
# Should return: 122.44.174.254
ping zn-01.com
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Database Authentication

**Status:** Non-critical warning

The backend shows:
```
Database operation note: Command createIndexes requires authentication
```

**Impact:** None - app works fine
**Cause:** MongoDB requires auth for admin operations
**Solution:** Optional, app works without it

To fix (if desired):
```bash
# Update backend/app/config.py with MongoDB credentials
MONGODB_URL = "mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/zero_world?authSource=admin"
```
